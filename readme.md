## Tone tape
### Description:
This is an app that dings random bells and whistles at random time intervals. The purpose of this is to play it as you study. Each time the sound is played, you are to write a (+) if you were doing what you are supposed to be doing, and a (-) if you were idle. It miraculously keeps you focused. 

The possible time of the next ding is highly variable. If dings were too close together, they would become destracting, but if the shortest time between dings was too long, you'd know that you have some time to be distracted before the first possible ding, so, it goes from 2 to 30 minutes.
